# Introduction

Developed a model that predicts errors in the demand forecast for an SSD product using historical demand data<br>
1. Conceptualized the idea after learning about limitations in existing models for demand forecasting, namely the assumption that demand is normally distributed. Since demand is non-normal in   Solidigmâ€™s SSD supply chain, the framework in most commercial demand modeling software needs improvement.<br>
2. Designed an algorithm that uses non-parametric kernel density estimations and overlapping continuous time intervals to generate a more accurate error metric for demand forecasts. 
3. An improved understanding of errors in demand forecasts help program planners, managers and market analysts improve future forecasts
4. Selected to present a poster on my research at the INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research) annual conference in 2022 as one of the few industry presentations. Received positive feedback from professors and other practitioners.<br>
