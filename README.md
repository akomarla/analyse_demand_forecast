# Introduction

Developed a new approach to calculate safety stock in the semiconductor Solid-State Drive (SSD) supply-chain. The model: (a). analyzes errors that have historically been made in demand forecasting, and (b). proposes a new approach to optimize the inventory safety stock using learnings from historical errors. An improved understanding of errors in demand forecasts, and  help program planners, managers and market analysts improve future forecasts <br>

Conceptualized the idea after learning about limitations in existing models for demand forecasting, namely the assumption that demand is normally distributed. This assumption is often baked into commercial demand modeling software and cannot be changed. But, since demand is non-normal in Solidigmâ€™s SSD supply chain, there is an opportunity to build a demand forecasting and there safety stock optimization model that does not make any assumption about normality.<br> Designed an algorithm that uses non-parametric kernel density estimations and overlapping continuous time intervals to tackle this problem.

Selected to present a poster on my research at the INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and Management Science) Annual Meeting in 2022 as one of the few industry presentations. Received positive feedback from professors and other practitioners.<br>
