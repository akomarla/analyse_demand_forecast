# Modeling and analysing errors in SSD demand forecasts

Developed a model that predicts errors in the demand forecast for an SSD product using historical demand data<br>
1. Came up with the idea after learning about limitations in existing models, namely the assumption that demand is normally distributed. Since demand is non-normal in   Solidigmâ€™s SSD supply chain, the current framework needs improvement.<br>
2. Designed an algorithm that uses non-parametric kernel density estimations and overlapping continuous time intervals to generate a more accurate error metric for demand forecasts. 
3. An improved understanding of errors in demand forecasts help program planners, managers and market analysts improve future forecasts
4. Selected to present a poster on my research at the INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research) annual conference in 2022. Received positive feedback from professors and other industry practitioners.<br>
