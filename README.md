# Modeling and analysis errors in SSD demand forecasts

Developed a model that predicts errors in the demand forecast for an SSD product using historical demand data
		○ Came up with the idea after learning about limitations in existing models, namely the assumption that demand is normally distributed. Since demand is non-normal in   Solidigm’s SSD supply chain, the current framework needs improvement.
		○ Designed a model that uses non-parametric kernel density estimations and overlapping continuous time intervals to generate a more accurate error metric for demand
		○ Selected to present a poster on my research at the INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research) annual conference in 2022. Received positive feedback from professors and other industry practitioners
